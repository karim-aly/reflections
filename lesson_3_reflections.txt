When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I have a project that i want to share with other people or when
    I have a project that have many contributors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because maybe I am working on a new feature and I want to make
    it work first then I will worry about pulling lastest changes
    and then merge them together.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is used when you don't have permission to a reposirory and you want
    It copied to your account.
    Clone is used when you want to copy a repository to your local machine.
    Branch is used when you want to work on a new feature or may be do some 
    experimental work on your code.
